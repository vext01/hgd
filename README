Hackathon Gunther Daemon
=========================

HGD is a music system suitable for hackathons, internet cafes, LAN
parties etc. Music is played on one set of speakers and clients queue up
media from their own machines over the network. Because we use MPlayer to play
media, you can send anything MPlayer understands, including video.

HGD was inspired by the LPD hack -- a music system used at OpenBSD
hackathons. We plan to implement similar functionality and extend it.

Current features
----------------

 * Network listener daemon.
 * Player daemon (uses mplayer).
 * Command line client with the ability queue and vote-off tracks.
 * Works on Linux and OpenBSD.

Prerequisites
-------------

To build, you will need:

 * Linux or OpenBSD (possibly others, not tested)
 * Make (either GNU or BSD)
 * GCC or Clang
 * SQLite3 libs and headers (if building servers).
 * OpenSSL libs and headers.
 * LibBSD (linux only) libs and headers.
 * Mplayer (for the server)

Building
--------

The build system is both bmake and gmake compatible, as it stands we use only
make.

 * To build everything, type 'make'.
 * To build only the client type 'make hgdc'.

Running
-------

If you are happy with putting HGD state in /var/hgd, then you can run the
two servers with no arguments:
 % hgd-netd
 % hgd-playd

Then you can queue tracks:
 % hgdc q <some media file>

Each command has a manual page for detailed usage instructions. Also,
each command has a '-h' option for quick help.

If you do not want to show the video of media files, 'unset DISPLAY' before
running hgd-playd.

For information on TLS encryption, see the manual page for hgd-netd(1).

History
-------

 * 0.1 - basic functionality
 * 0.2 - TLS crypto support and authentication.

Roadmap
-------

 * 0.3 - Admin commands and mplayer slave mode.
 * 0.4 - Fair share playlist

Developers
----------

 * Code style is as described in the style(9) OpenBSD manual page.
   http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9
 * All of our functions are prefixed 'hgd_'
 * All of our macros are defined in .h files and are prefixed HGD_ other
   than in certain (generic) cases (SERROR).
 * All database code should go in db.c.
 * Any other common functionality should go in common.c.
 * Debugging is done via DPRINTF at the appropriate debug level.
 * Exit is done via hgd_exit_nicely() -- each program has it's own
   implementation. You should try to call this as far up the call stack
   as possible, so that as much stuff is free()d/closed as possible
   before exit.
 * DO NOT JUST COMMIT, YOU MUST GET AN OK FROM ME FIRST!
   Mail the diff to <vext01 (at) gmail (dot) com> for review.
 * Make sure you have your git client configured correctly with respect
   to user.name and user.email. They should be the same as on github.
   (Yes, older commits have other usernames, that's because the code was
   imported from privately hosted CVS).

Bugs
----

Inevitable. Please report bugs on github.
