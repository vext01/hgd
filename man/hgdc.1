.Sh A NOTE ABOUT ENCRYPTION

You can turn off SSL encryption or refuse speak to servers if they don't
support SSL with -E and -e respectively; however the default behaviour
involves a handshake between the client and server, favouring an
encrypted connection if possible, otherwise falling back onto
unencrypted socket communication.

A warning is always printed if SSL encryption is not enabled.
.Sh HISTORY
HGD was inspired by the LPD hack -- a music system used at OpenBSD hackathons.
