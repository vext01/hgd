.Sh A NOTE ABOUT ENCRYPTION
NOTE: SSL support in HGD is fine as-is for encryption purposes, but host
authentication (proving the server identity) is NOT (yet) implemented.
.Pp
You can turn off SSL encryption or refuse speak to servers if they don't
support SSL with -E and -e respectively; however the default behaviour
involves a handshake between the client and server, favouring an
encrypted connection if possible, otherwise falling back onto
unencrypted socket communication.
.Pp
A warning is always printed if SSL encryption is not enabled.
.Sh FILES
.Nm
can read it's settings from a config file. The following locations
(in the order shown) are searched:

.It
