  * valgrind
 
Next version:
 * have playd set all playing to 0 on crash/exit?
 * man page
 * authentication
 * admin commands
 * have netd send whether playd is playing in ls?

If someone gets bored:
 * review all debug messages - are they the right level?
 * make some more sql quries generic and put in db.c
